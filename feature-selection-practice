# House Prices Modeling Task
# Objective: Build the best-fitting model based on R-squared using various features of house data.
# Note: This script omits exploratory analyses performed to understand the data.
# Reflection: Using 19 features likely caused overfitting, but this was a fun learning experience.

# Load the House Prices dataset
HP <- read.csv("HousePrices.csv")

# Data Preprocessing

# Remove variables that are not relevant or do not contribute to the analysis
HP <- HP[, -c(1, 14, 15:16)]

# Remove outliers (houses priced above $6 million)
HP <- HP[HP$price < 6e+06, ]

#Feature Selection

# Load required library
library(leaps)

# Perform exhaustive feature selection to evaluate the best subset of features
exhaustive_mod <- regsubsets(price ~ ., data = HP, method = "exhaustive", nvmax = 19, really.big = TRUE)
exhaustive_summary <- summary(exhaustive_mod)

# Identify the best model based on different criteria
best_adjr2 <- which.max(exhaustive_summary$adjr2)  # Model with the highest adjusted R-squared
best_bic <- which.min(exhaustive_summary$bic)      # Model with the lowest BIC
best_cp <- which.min(exhaustive_summary$cp)        # Model with the lowest Cp

# Display results
cat("Best model based on adjusted R-squared:", best_adjr2, "\n")
cat("Best model based on BIC:", best_bic, "\n")
cat("Best model based on Cp:", best_cp, "\n")
print(exhaustive_summary)

# Convert Categorical Variables to Dummy Variables

# Load required library
library(caret)

# Create dummy variables for categorical features
dummy <- dummyVars(" ~ .", data = HP)
HP_dummy <- data.frame(predict(dummy, newdata = HP))

# Build a Linear Model

# Fit a linear regression model with selected features
linear_mod <- lm(price ~ yr_built +
                   bedrooms^2 * sqft_living * sqft_above * waterfront * view *
                   cityClyde.Hill + cityBellevue + cityKirkland +
                   cityMedina + cityMercer.Island + cityRedmond +
                   citySeattle + citySammamish + cityIssaquah, 
                 data = HP_dummy)

# Display the model summary
