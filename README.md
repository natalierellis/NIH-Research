# NIH Research

This repository contains scripts, data, and documentation from my research and coursework at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The folder is organized into two main subdirectories, each serving a distinct purpose:

## 1. Epigenetic Age Analysis of Alcoholic Cohorts
Research scripts and analyses investigating the relationship between alcohol-related phenotypes and epigenetic age acceleration (EAA).

## 2. Statistics Class Scripts
Coursework materials developed during the **Statistics for Biomedical Researchers** class, showcasing foundational statistical and data science techniques.
