My repository provides examples of code that I have used to clean, analyze, and visualize data in past research projects while employed by Wake Forest University and the NIH. 

"Stats Class" files include scripts that I wrote to practice regression, phylogenetic tree construction, model engineering, and machine learning techniques in my Statistics for Biomedical Research course at the NIH.
