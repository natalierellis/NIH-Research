Hello!
This repository provides examples of code that I have used in past research projects. 
In my undergraduate research experience, I used the RNA-Seq limma-voom pipeline from UC Davis to analyze timecourse contrasts of droughted Acacia samples. 
I also created volcano plots to visualize significant DEGs.
