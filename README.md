My repository provides examples of code that I have used to clean, analysize, and visualize data in past research projects while employed by Wake Forest University and the NIH. 

"Stats Class" files include scripts that I wrote to complete practice problems for my Statistics for Biomedical Research course I completed at the NIH.
