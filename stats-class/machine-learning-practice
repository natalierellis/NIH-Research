# Analysis with Faithful Dataset and Machine Learning Models
# The AnAge data is no longer accessible, so we focus on the Faithful dataset in this script.

# Question 1: K-Means Clustering on Faithful Data 
library(tidyverse)

# Load and view the Faithful dataset
# This dataset comes pre-installed with R and provides data on Old Faithful geyser eruptions.
data(faithful)  # Loads the dataset into R
View(faithful)  # Opens the data viewer window

# Plot data to visualize potential clusters
ggplot(faithful, aes(x = waiting, y = eruptions)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Faithful Data: Initial Visualization", x = "Waiting Time", y = "Eruption Duration")

# Apply k-means clustering
kvals <- kmeans(faithful, centers = 2)

# Add cluster assignments to the dataset
faithful$cluster <- as.factor(kvals$cluster)

# Plot clusters with k-means centers
ggplot(faithful, aes(x = waiting, y = eruptions, color = cluster)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_point(data = as.data.frame(kvals$centers), aes(x = waiting, y = eruptions), 
             color = "red", shape = 4, size = 4) +
  labs(title = "K-Means Clustering on Faithful Data", x = "Waiting Time", y = "Eruption Duration")

# Conclusion: The clusters appear reasonable based on the plotted data.

# Question 2: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on Faithful Data ===
# Calculate principal components
pcs <- prcomp(faithful, scale. = TRUE)
summary(pcs)

# Add PC1 and PC2 to the dataset
faithful$PC1 <- pcs$x[, 1]
faithful$PC2 <- pcs$x[, 2]

# Visualize data with PC1 and PC2
ggplot(faithful, aes(x = eruptions, y = waiting, size = PC1, color = PC2)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Faithful Data: PCA Visualization", x = "Eruption Duration", y = "Waiting Time")

# Define clusters based on PC1 and PC2
faithful$PC1_cluster <- ifelse(faithful$PC1 > mean(faithful$PC1), "1", "2")
faithful$PC2_cluster <- ifelse(faithful$PC2 > mean(faithful$PC2), "1", "2")

# Visualize clusters based on PC1
ggplot(faithful, aes(x = eruptions, y = waiting, color = PC1_cluster)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Clusters Based on PC1", x = "Eruption Duration", y = "Waiting Time")

# Visualize clusters based on PC2
ggplot(faithful, aes(x = eruptions, y = waiting, color = PC2_cluster)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Clusters Based on PC2", x = "Eruption Duration", y = "Waiting Time")

# Conclusion: The clusters based on both PC1 and PC2 appear to represent meaningful divisions of the data.

# Note: AnAge Data
# The AnAge dataset previously used for random forest and neural network models is no longer accessible.
# This script now focuses on the Faithful dataset for clustering and PCA analysis.
