# Phylogenetic Tree Analysis and Tree Discordance Measurement
# This script compares tree discordance between two alignments of the same gene (TNF).
# Alignments are matched and trimmed to ensure comparable trees.

# Step 1: Build Tree Topology from UCSC Alignment 
# Read alignment data
dat_ucsc <- read.phyDat("TNF (1).fasta", type = "AA", format = "fasta")

# Calculate pairwise distances
dm_ucsc <- dist.ml(dat_ucsc)

# Build a distance-based starter tree
tree_ucsc <- fastme.bal(dm_ucsc)

# Optimize tree using maximum likelihood
fit_ucsc <- pml(tree_ucsc, dat_ucsc, k = 4, inv = 0.2)
fit_ucsc <- optim.pml(fit_ucsc, optNni = TRUE, optGamma = TRUE, optInv = TRUE, model = "LG")

# Reroot the tree with a specified outgroup
tree_ucsc_rooted <- root.phylo(fit_ucsc$tree, outgroup = "monDom5", resolve.root = TRUE)

# Plot the rooted tree
plot(tree_ucsc_rooted)
title(main = "TNF UCSC Alignment", font.main = 2)

# Step 2: Build Tree Topology from Hiller Alignment ===
# Read alignment data
dat_hiller <- read.phyDat("TNF (1).phy", type = "AA", format = "phy")

# Calculate pairwise distances
dm_hiller <- dist.ml(dat_hiller)

# Build a distance-based starter tree
tree_hiller <- fastme.bal(dm_hiller)

# Optimize tree using maximum likelihood
fit_hiller <- pml(tree_hiller, dat_hiller, k = 4, inv = 0.2)
fit_hiller <- optim.pml(fit_hiller, optNni = TRUE, optGamma = TRUE, optInv = TRUE, model = "LG")

# Reroot the tree with a specified outgroup
tree_hiller_rooted <- root.phylo(fit_hiller$tree, outgroup = "monDom5", resolve.root = TRUE)

# Plot the rooted tree
plot(tree_hiller_rooted)
title(main = "TNF Hiller Alignment", font.main = 2)

# Step 3: Match and Trim Trees ===
# Identify common tip labels between the two trees
common_tips <- tree_hiller_rooted$tip.label[
  tree_hiller_rooted$tip.label %in% tree_ucsc_rooted$tip.label
]

# Trim both trees to include only the common tips
tree_ucsc_trimmed <- drop.tip(tree_ucsc_rooted, setdiff(tree_ucsc_rooted$tip.label, common_tips))
tree_hiller_trimmed <- drop.tip(tree_hiller_rooted, setdiff(tree_hiller_rooted$tip.label, common_tips))

# Step 4: Measure Tree Discordance ===
# Calculate Robinson-Foulds distance (ignoring branch lengths)
rf_distance <- RF.dist(tree_ucsc_trimmed, tree_hiller_trimmed)
cat("Robinson-Foulds Distance (Ignoring Branch Lengths):", rf_distance, "\n")

# Calculate weighted Robinson-Foulds distance (using branch lengths)
weighted_rf_distance <- wRF.dist(tree_ucsc_trimmed, tree_hiller_trimmed)
cat("Weighted Robinson-Foulds Distance (Using Branch Lengths):", weighted_rf_distance, "\n")
