# Analysis of Relationships and Regression Models

# Question 1: Inspect Variables in mtcars 
# Variables: disp, hp, drat, qsec
# Goal: Identify pairs that appear to be correlated

# Pairwise scatterplots
pairs(mtcars[, c("disp", "hp", "drat", "qsec")],
      main = "Pairwise Scatterplots of Selected Variables")

# Observations:
# - `disp` and `hp` appear to be correlated
# - `disp` and `drat` appear to be correlated
# - `hp` and `qsec` appear to have some correlation

# Question 2: Linear Models with Interaction Terms 

# Model without interaction terms
mod2 <- lm(mpg ~ disp + hp + drat + qsec, data = mtcars)

# Model with interaction terms
mod3 <- lm(mpg ~ disp + hp + drat + qsec + disp:hp + disp:drat + hp:qsec, data = mtcars)

# Question 3: Compare Model Fits

# Summaries of both models
summary(mod2)
summary(mod3)

# Observations:
# The model with interaction terms (mod3) has a better fit based on adjusted R-squared.

# Question 4: Polynomial Regression on airquality Data 

# Load the airquality dataset
data("airquality")

# Scatterplot of Temp vs. Ozone
plot(airquality$Temp, airquality$Ozone,
     main = "Scatterplot of Temp vs. Ozone",
     xlab = "Temperature",
     ylab = "Ozone")

# Polynomial regression (degree 2)
poly_mod <- lm(Ozone ~ poly(Temp, degree = 2), data = airquality)

# Predictions for the polynomial regression
temp_seq <- seq(from = min(airquality$Temp, na.rm = TRUE), 
                to = max(airquality$Temp, na.rm = TRUE), 
                by = 0.1)
poly_preds <- predict(poly_mod, newdata = data.frame(Temp = temp_seq))

# Add polynomial regression line to the plot
lines(temp_seq, poly_preds, col = "red", lwd = 2)
legend("topright", legend = "Polynomial Regression (degree 2)", col = "red", lwd = 2)

# Question 5: Spline Regression on airquality Data

# Spline regression with specified knots
library(splines)
knots <- quantile(airquality$Temp, c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75), na.rm = TRUE)
spline_mod <- lm(Ozone ~ bs(Temp, knots = knots), data = airquality)

# Predictions for the spline regression
spline_preds <- predict(spline_mod, newdata = data.frame(Temp = temp_seq))

# Plot spline regression curve
plot(airquality$Temp, airquality$Ozone,
     main = "Scatterplot of Temp vs. Ozone with Spline Fit",
     xlab = "Temperature",
     ylab = "Ozone")
lines(temp_seq, spline_preds, col = "blue", lwd = 2)
legend("topright", legend = "Spline Regression", col = "blue", lwd = 2)
