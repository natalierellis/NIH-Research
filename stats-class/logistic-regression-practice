# Logistic Regression Analysis with mtcars Data

# Question 1: Logistic Regression to Distinguish 8-Cyl Cars 
# Create a binary variable for 8-cylinder vs. non-8-cylinder cars
mtcars$new_cyl <- ifelse(mtcars$cyl == 8, 1, 0)

# Fit logistic regression model using mpg and drat as predictors
modlog <- glm(new_cyl ~ mpg + drat, data = mtcars, family = binomial(link = "logit"))

# Question 2: Check Log-Odds Linearity Assumption
# Predict log-odds from the model
mtcars$logodds <- predict(modlog, type = "link")

# Pairwise scatterplots to check linearity
pairs(mtcars[, c("logodds", "mpg", "drat")],
      main = "Log-Odds vs Predictors")

# Observation:
# Check if log-odds have a linear relationship with predictors mpg and drat.

# Question 3: Model Output and Interpretation 
# Display model summary
summary(modlog)

# Interpretation:
# - `mpg` is a significant predictor (p-value < 0.05).
# - As `mpg` increases, the likelihood of a car being 8-cylinder decreases.

# Question 4: Confusion Matrix and Model Accuracy 
# Make predictions on the probability scale
preds <- predict(modlog, type = "response")

# Convert probabilities to binary predictions
predsbin <- ifelse(preds > 0.5, 1, 0)

# Create confusion matrix
conf_matrix1 <- table(Actual = mtcars$new_cyl, Predicted = predsbin)
print(conf_matrix1)

# Accuracy:
accuracy1 <- sum(diag(conf_matrix1)) / sum(conf_matrix1)
cat("Accuracy of Model 1:", accuracy1, "\n")

# Question 5: Logistic Regression with Additional Predictor 
# Fit a new logistic regression model including carb as a predictor
modlog2 <- glm(new_cyl ~ mpg + drat + carb, data = mtcars, family = binomial(link = "logit"))

# Display model summary
summary(modlog2)

# Question 6: Compare Model Fit (AIC) 
cat("AIC of Model 1:", AIC(modlog), "\n")
cat("AIC of Model 2:", AIC(modlog2), "\n")

# Observation:
# Model 2 has a higher AIC, indicating worse fit compared to Model 1.

# Question 7: Compare Predictive Accuracy 
# Make predictions with Model 2
preds2 <- predict(modlog2, type = "response")
predsbin2 <- ifelse(preds2 > 0.5, 1, 0)

# Create confusion matrix for Model 2
conf_matrix2 <- table(Actual = mtcars$new_cyl, Predicted = predsbin2)
print(conf_matrix2)

# Accuracy:
accuracy2 <- sum(diag(conf_matrix2)) / sum(conf_matrix2)
cat("Accuracy of Model 2:", accuracy2, "\n")

# Observation:
# Model 2 has lower predictive accuracy compared to Model 1.

# Summary of Findings 
# 1. Model 1 (mpg and drat) has better fit (lower AIC) and higher predictive accuracy.
# 2. Adding `carb` as a predictor in Model 2 increases complexity without improving performance.
