# Statistics Class Scripts

This folder contains scripts developed during the **Statistics for Biomedical Researchers** course (2-credit class offered by FAES). The scripts demonstrate a variety of statistical analysis techniques, including:

- **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessing and handling missing data.
- **Modeling and Model Selection**: Building regression models, evaluating fit, and selecting optimal models.
- **Phylogenetic Tree Analysis**: Building, trimming, and comparing phylogenetic trees for biological sequence data.
- **Basic Machine Learning**: Logistic regression, tree-based methods, and evaluating model performance.

## About the Class
This class focused on applying statistical techniques in biomedical research contexts. Through practical problem-solving, I worked on real-world questions and applied methods to analyze datasets effectively.

## Contents
1. **Logistic Regression Models**:
   - Scripts for distinguishing groups using logistic regression with interaction terms.
   - Examples include confusion matrices and predictive accuracy comparisons.

2. **Phylogenetic Tree Analysis**:
   - Methods to calculate tree discordance using Robinson-Foulds distance.
   - Scripts for building, matching, and trimming phylogenetic trees for gene alignments.

3. **Linear Regression and Polynomial Fits**:
   - Analysis of non-linear relationships using polynomial regression and splines.
   - Includes visualization of fitted curves on scatterplots.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - R-squared comparisons, adjusted AIC/BIC values, and residual diagnostics.
   - Focus on choosing parsimonious models with strong predictive power.

5. **Practice Problems**:
   - Solutions to statistical challenges provided as class exercises.

## Purpose
These scripts were created as part of class practice problems to explore and solidify my understanding of statistical methods. They provide a foundation for addressing more complex biomedical data analysis challenges.
