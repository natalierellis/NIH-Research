# Statistics Class Scripts

This folder contains scripts and data developed during the **Statistics for Biomedical Researchers** course (2-credit class offered by FAES). The scripts demonstrate a variety of statistical and data science techniques, including:

- **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessing and handling missing data.
- **Modeling and Model Selection**: Building regression models, evaluating fit, and selecting optimal models.
- **Phylogenetic Tree Analysis**: Building, trimming, and comparing phylogenetic trees for biological sequence data.
- **Basic Machine Learning**: Logistic regression, tree-based methods, and evaluating model performance.
- **Nonlinear Regression**: Modeling non-linear relationships using polynomial regression and splines.

## About the Class
This class focused on applying statistical and data science techniques in biomedical research contexts. Through practical problem-solving, I worked on real-world questions and applied methods to analyze datasets effectively.

## Contents
1. **HousePrices.csv**:
   - Dataset for practicing regression modeling and feature selection.

2. **basic-stats-commands**:
   - A script demonstrating foundational statistical commands and techniques.

3. **feature-selection-practice**:
   - Exercises in selecting optimal features for regression models using techniques like exhaustive search.

4. **logistic-regression-practice**:
   - Scripts for solving classification problems, including building logistic regression models with interaction terms and evaluating predictive performance.

5. **machine-learning-practice**:
   - Demonstrations of machine learning models, such as decision trees and logistic regression, focusing on performance evaluation.

6. **nonlinear-regression-practice**:
   - Scripts exploring non-linear relationships using polynomial regression and splines, with visualizations.

7. **phylogenetic-analysis-practice**:
   - Methods for building, trimming, and comparing phylogenetic trees using biological sequence data.
   - Includes Robinson-Foulds distance calculations for tree discordance.

8. **TNF (1).fasta**:
   - FASTA alignment file for phylogenetic tree analysis.

9. **TNF (1).phy**:
   - PHY alignment file for phylogenetic tree analysis.

10. **README.md**:
    - Documentation of the folder contents and purpose.

## Purpose
These scripts and datasets were created as part of class practice problems to explore and solidify my understanding of statistical and data science methods. They provide a foundation for addressing more complex biomedical data analysis challenges.
