1. Inspect the following variables in the mtcars dataset: disp, hp, drat, qsec
# Which pairs appear to be correlated?
pairs(mtcars[, colnames(mtcars)%in%c("disp", "hp", "drat", "qsec")])
#disp and hp appear to be correlated
#disp and draft aeppear to be correlated
#hp and qsec 
#2. Create a linear model with interaction terms based on your answer to #1
# to predict mpg
mod2<- lm(mpg~ disp + hp + drat + qsec, data=mtcars)
mod3 <- lm(mpg~ disp + hp + drat + qsec + disp:hp + disp:drat + hp:qsec, data=mtcars)

#3. How does the fit of your model in #2 compare to the fit of the model with no interactors?
summary(mod2)
summary(mod3)

#Model with interaction terms is better 
#4. In the airquality dataset, the relationship between Temp and Ozone is non-linear.
# Fit a polynomial regression to model the relationship.
# Plot your curve on top of a scatterplot of the two variables.
plot(airquality$Temp, airquality$Ozone)
#looks exponential 
data("airquality")
mod=lm(Ozone~poly(Temp, degree=2), data=airquality)
preds=predict(mod, newdata=data.frame(Temp=seq(from=min(airquality$Temp), to=max(airquality$Temp), by=.1)))
plot(airquality$Temp, airquality$Ozone)
lines(seq(from=min(airquality$Temp), to=max(airquality$Temp), by=.1), preds, col="red")
#5. Using splines is an alternative to polynomial regression.
# Fit a regression model using splines to model the relationship between Temp and Ozone.
# Plot your curve on top of a scatterplot of the two variables
library(splines)
quantile(airquality$Temp, c(.25, .5, .75))
mod5<- lm(airquality$Ozone~bs(airquality$Temp, knots = c(72,79,85)))
mod5=lm(Ozone~bs(Temp, knots=c(72,79,85)), data=airquality)
preds=predict(mod5, newdata=data.frame(Temp=seq(from=min(airquality$Temp), to=max(airquality$Temp), by=.1)))
plot(airquality$Temp, airquality$Ozone)
lines(seq(from=min(airquality$Temp), to=max(airquality$Temp), by=.1), preds, col="red")
#6. Of the models in 4 and 5, which appears to visually fit the data best?
# Which is best according to model fit criteria?
